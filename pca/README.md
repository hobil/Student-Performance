This notebook shows how to perform PCA decomposition step by step on the dataset of handwritten digits. The notebook shows:

1. How to transform the dataset to 2 dimensions using PCA in numpy
2. How to select the number of components
3. How plotting the components helps to understand data
4. What do the principal components actually mean
5. How to perform PCA using scikit-learn with the same results

The notebook served originally as a task for Data Mining student at the University of Hamburg.
